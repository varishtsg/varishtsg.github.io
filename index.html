            <div class="text">So I'm a developer, designer, gamer, anime lover who goes by the name "Varisht Ghedia". A lot of people seem to call me "Scientist" mainly because of my over the top crazy ideas. they start simple but eventually end up becoming pretty badass and efficient.</div>
    
            <div class="text">I have worked on machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence and computer vision. Previously I have worked on object detection and recognition using OpenCV and a lot of other crazy projects that I conveniently forget. Python is my preferred language after english.</div>
    
            <div class="text">I do web design some times. The lack of a "proper" design on this page only means that it is still work in progress and should get done eventually. Meanwhile you can check out my blog <a href="https://www.varisht.dev/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://www.varisht.dev/" target="_blank">here</a> & <a href="https://www.varisht.dev/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>
